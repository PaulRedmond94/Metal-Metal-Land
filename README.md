# Metal-Metal-Land

“Metal Metal Land” is a procedurally generated, multiplayer action game
implemented using the Unity (C#) game engine with the goal of it being as fast paced
as possible with as minimal load times as possible. It involves two players selecting
characters, each representing different sub-genres of metal (such as Old-School
British Metal, Pirate Metal, Thrash Metal etc.) and fighting to the death in a
procedurally generated, destructible arena using a variety of weapons, power-ups and
environmental objects to do so.

The key goal of this project is to produce a fast paced local multiplayer action game.
As technology has improved, the physical interaction between players as they play
games with one another has faded away more and more, being replaced with online
multiplayer almost entirely. The absence of traditional “couch-based” local
multiplayer in modern games has not gone unnoticed and there has been a cry for a
return to the local multiplayer games of old from a large section of the gaming
community. I am in agreement with this view and while I appreciate the convenience
that the modern online-based multiplayer provides, it does leave me wanting for
games similar to the ones I grew up with.

When the game boots up, players are presented with the main menu, containing links
about how to play the game, game options and the actual play-game button. If players
are already familiar with the game and its rules, they should be able to begin playing
the game within 10 seconds of arriving on the main menu. Once they begin playing,
they will be presented with minimal interruptions so as to not negatively impact the
flow of the game. The feedback from initially testing this game showed me that
people were very open to, and fans of, the minimal load times and rapid pace of the
game.
